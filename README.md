Uses This is a nerdy interview website, asking people what they use to _get the job done_.

It's a static site generated by [my dumb little site generator](http://github.com/waferbaby/dimples/ "A very simple static site generator."), and it even has its own static API!

Interested in cloning the site for your own interviews (similar or otherwise)? HELL YEAH, DO IT! And then let me know - I'd love to add it to the Community page!
