### Who are you, and what do you do?

Hi! I'm a web server error code. I tend to show up when people make a request for something that doesn't exist, or used to exist.

### What hardware do you use?

I'm really, _really_ into servers - it's what I grew up with, and it's all I know.

I have a MacBook Pro at home.

### And what software?

I tend to focus to web server software (and hey, I'm easy, I'll work with any of 'em - no favourites). Keep it simple.

### What would be your dream setup?

This is pretty much it. Although, just quietly, I'd love it if people would take more care of their pages on the web - it would make my life _so_ much easier, y'know?
