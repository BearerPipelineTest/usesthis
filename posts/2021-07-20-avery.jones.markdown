### Who are you, and what do you do?

I am Avery Jones, the owner and founder of [Shooting Star Creamery](https://www.shootingstarcreamery.com/ "Avery's cheese company."). I am a high school artisan cheese maker from the central coast of California, primarily focused on sheep and cow milk cheeses.

### What hardware do you use?

I use an Alienware laptop to run my business as I often work from home due to having to keep up with classes.

We use a 500 gallon C.Vant Reit Dutch cheese making vat and all of our milk is pasteurized in this unit. We also use a traditional pre-press stainless steel draining table and pneumatic cheese presses. All of our cheeses are brined in a saturated salt solution and then aged on pine wood planks and flipped by hand until they are ready for sale.

### And what software?

I use [Squarespace][] for my business's website since I learned how to use it in school and noticed it had many pre-existing templates for businesses.

### What would be your dream setup?

My dream setup would be to have a desktop at work and a designated laptop or tablet for when I need to travel and do business. It would also be useful to have these additional devices so I don't get my files for schoolwork and my files for Shooting Star Creamery mixed up.
