### Who are you, and what do you do?

My name is [Rich Vreeland](http://disasterpeace.com/ "Rich's website."), and I do lots of sound related things using the alias 'Disasterpeace'. I've primarily created soundtracks for various things, but I've also done a lot of sound design, audio implementation for games, procedural music system designs, music software, audio direction, songwriting, live performance, etc.

### What hardware do you use?

I try to keep my hardware setup as minimal as possible. I have a [2012 MacBook Pro][macbook-pro] that I use for all of my work, and an iPad I occasionally mess with too. I've got a pair of [Sennheiser HD 600s][hd-600], Yamaha HS8 monitors + sub, and an old Novation Remote SL 61-Key MIDI Controller. I've also got a Yamaha Upright Piano that I love very much, and a few guitars. I wanna buy an electronic drum kit.

I figured out that having a big desk was eating into my stereo field, so I switched it up for a very small, shallow desk, which is actually a piece of composite wood I found in my backyard, vice gripped together with Floyd Legs. I usually mount a big flat screen display to the wall in front of me, behind my monitors (speakers).

I went through a ergonomics phase where I became totally obsessed with improving my sense of comfort and flow while working, and came out the other side with a [Herman Miller Embody chair][embody], and a 'skateboard footrest' called a [Webble][].

### And what software?

In the past I've done audio work with [GarageBand][], [Pro Tools][pro-tools] and [Reason][], but for the last 8 or 9 years I've primarily used [Logic Pro][logic-pro]. I've started building my own MIDI Scripts for Logic too, which allow me to approach creative problems [from different angles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUlL0qANfVc "Rich's YouTube video of his MIDI Scripts.").

For code and web work I went way down the rabbit hole with [Sublime Text][sublime-text], which is a highly customizable text editor. From there I can upload directly to my FTP server, do build tests for software/games, and lots of other related things. For real-time CSS editing I use [Espresso][], and for Git like to keep things simple for myself with [Gitbox][], and [Kaleidoscope][] for file differential.

For two-track audio editing I use [Sound Studio][sound-studio] (for quick simple things) and [Izotope RX][rx] (for more corrective repairs / etc). For batch audio processing I use [Max][] (for quick simple things) and [Myriad][] (for more elaborate processes). I use [Keyboard Maestro][keyboard-maestro] to automate a lot of the repetitive tasks I do on my computer, and to automatically do things in tandem. One example is I use it to run a shell script to automatically pull the latest list of blog post tags from my website whenever I open Sublime Text, so that up to date tags show up as autocomplete options when creating blog posts in [Markdown][]. I also use it translate phrases to French without having to go to Google Translate (which probably isn't saving me much time, but it's fun!).

### What would be your dream setup?

My dream setup is to work in a supremely comfortable, quiet, minimal space with great lighting that is a short walk from where I live. An AR interface for working with software is something that appeals to me too. One day..
