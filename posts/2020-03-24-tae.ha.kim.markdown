### Who are you, and what do you do?

My name is [Tae Ha Kim](https://www.taehatypes.com/ "Tae Ha's website.") and I am currently a full time [YouTuber](https://www.youtube.com/taehatypes "Tae Ha's YouTube account.") and [Twitch streamer](https://www.twitch.tv/taehatypes "Tae Ha's Twitch account.") that creates content for the custom mechanical keyboards scene and hobby.

I used to be a software engineer at IBM before pursuing content creation full time. Some of the content I create involve livestreaming the build process of assembling a custom mechanical keyboard, tutorials, and reviews. I've had the opportunity to work with many high profile streamers and gamers as I've gained traction.

### What hardware do you use?

I am primarily a PC user as a Twitch streamer and use Adobe for all my editing. Here are [my PC specs](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/Jj67hg "Tae Ha's computer build.") (list is missing my primary monitor which is a Dell [UltraSharp 32" UP3216Q][ultrasharp-up3216q].)

As for keyboards, I rotate through the plethora of keyboards I use about every 2 weeks. My current mice of choice are the Logitech [MX Master 3][mx-master] for productivity and the Logitech [G Pro Wireless][g-pro-wireless] for gaming. I haven't dived fully into the audiophile world yet but when it comes to listening, I use the Ultimate Ears [UE LIVE CIEMs][ue-live].

I'm pretty serious when it comes to video production so I've collected my fair share of equipment over the years. I currently stream using the Sony [A7R III][a7r-iii] and [A6500][], but recently picked up a Canon [C200][eos-c200] to start creating professional YouTube videos. I've been a self-taught photographer before entering the video space and have a selection of lights ranging from the Aputure 120D and other Aputure lights to recently picking up some Astera light tubes. As a content creator who also live streams for many hours every day, ergonomics were important to me and a standing desk was a must, for which I went with the Uplift [V2][] as my choice. As for my chair, I fortunately had a friend who was able to get me a brand new Herman Miller [Aeron][] for half the retail price.

### And what software?

I use Adobe [Creative Cloud][creative-cloud] offerings for all my editing! I stream using OBS and StreamElements.

Other software that I use daily include [Sublime Text][sublime-text] (which I use for basic jotting down of notes and some light programming here and there), [Discord][], [QMK][] (open source software for remapping keyboards), VIA, [Spotify][], as well as some gaming here and there.

### What would be your dream setup?

My dream setup would be to have an even stronger computer with a higher end monitor dedicated for gaming and probably an Eizo monitor for colorgrading. You can never have too much camera gear and I would love to own the new Canon [C500 MKII][eos-c500-mark-ii] that just came out!

Also can never have enough lighting and lenses. I would love to dive deeper into the audiophile space and try out more high-end headphones and in ear monitors (can't really name specifics as I'm not too aware of what's even out there.)
