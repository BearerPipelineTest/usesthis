#### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm [a cartoonist](http://www.sharkbrains.com/ "Kate's website.") and [art therapist](http://www.nolartslearningcenter.com/ "A nonprofit teaching art to young people with special needs."). I run [creative arts workshops](https://www.nolartslearningcenter.com/join-the-stomp-troopers.html "The STOMP Troopers special needs art group.") for young people with autism and other special needs here in New Orleans. About 15% of that is actual hands-on art therapy, the rest is management, supervision, grant writing, advocacy and planning, planning, planning. I recently gave a [TEDx talk on inclusivity through the lens of autism and Mardi Gras](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFN8FOoIVHI "Kate's TEDx talk on YouTube."). My personal work is creating comics about the body. The best ready-made category for it is "body-horror", since it involves a lot of grotesque, disturbing and sexual content. But the effect is not scary so much as sickening and funny, hopefully beautiful as well. My ongoing series, [Vivisectionary](http://studygroupcomics.com/main/vivisectionary-by-kate-lacour/ "Kate's biology-based comic series."), is based on biology diagrams, and [The Disciple](http://studygroupcomics.com/main/disciple-by-kate-lacour/ "Kate's comic about a mystic.") covers the metaphysical degradation of a would-be mystic.

#### What hardware do you use?

I draw everything in archival ink on the cheapest watercolor paper available, then paint with a blend of watercolors, colored inks and watercolor dyes. I have finally transitioned to a high-quality watercolor brush, and it's transformed my art, not so much in terms of the final product, but the ease with which I can arrive there. I use the tarot occasionally for guidance on The Disciple and anatomical references or high school biology texts for ideas for Vivisectionary.

#### And what software?

I use [Photoshop][] to make minor tweaks to my scanned artwork. By far, the most useful piece of technology is Google image search on my iPad. I'm old enough to remember a time in high school when I kept books pasted full of magazine clippings that I'd use for visual reference when drawing- some gross, some beautiful, some merely useful. Nowadays, I can Google anything I need to see in order to complete a page. My search history is pretty strange and embarrassing: horse testicles, barber chair, 1970s blender, vulva, human heart, ham are some of the most recent queries.

#### What would be your dream setup?

I finally have my ideal physical setup - a tiny desk, an iPad, an expensive paintbrush, a quiet little room for art making. I'm also lucky enough to have a nice little suburban house, two children and a full-time job. My dream would be having a babysitter or housekeeper to cover for me while I make more art.
