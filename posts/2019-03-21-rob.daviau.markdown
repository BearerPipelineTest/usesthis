### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm [Rob Daviau](http://www.robdaviau.com/ "Rob's website.") and I'm a board game designer. I think of ideas, make prototypes, and then test them until the game is done. I do not take the game to a print-ready/manufacturing state. That is up to a publisher. My goal is to make a good playing game.

### What hardware do you use?

A [MacBook Pro][macbook-pro] and a four-color home printer. Scissors. Markers. An x-acto blade. Pens. A notebook.

### And what software?

I'm in [Google Docs][google-docs] and [Sheets][google-sheets] a lot. I do a lot of collaborating with remote people and we share documents. Docs are used for ideas and rules. Sheets are used for card design. I use [Adobe InDesign][indesign] to import spreadsheet data into cards and tokens. [Adobe Illustrator][illustrator] and [Photoshop][] lets me build other components such as a gameboard. I spend a lot of time in meetings via [Skype][]. Other than that it is email and the basic [Apple Notes][notes]. I've tried planning software and checklist software over the years but it is always too robust for my needs.

### What would be your dream setup?

I'd like a 3D printer for physical components such as game pieces, and it would be nice to have something that could cut out all my parts. Both of these are in market; I just haven't taken the jump to buying either a 3D printer or a cutter. I also work from home and never have a good place to put my physical prototypes. My kids are tired of half-finished games on the dining room table. Getting a proper studio with some large tables would help a lot.

Mostly I'd like to have playtesters on call, who can show up to play a game when needed. I'm likely to move to a larger city in a few years and that might help with that issue.
