### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm [Frances Berriman](https://fberriman.com). I'm a British designer, developer and artist living in San Francisco. I do a variety of things, including freelance product design consultancy and front-end development but most notably I have tended to work on public sector technology projects. For example, I worked on the [award-winning re-design of GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/govuk-wins-design-of-the-year-2013 "An article about gov.uk winning Design of the Year in 2013.") for the [UK Government Digital Service](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/ "The UK's Government Digital Service.") and later worked with [Code for America](https://www.codeforamerica.org/ "An organisation working to improve government technology.").

These days, I am focusing more of my time on my other interests --- IoT and Smart Homes, via my site [Sensors and Sensibility](https://www.sensorsandsensibility.com "Frances' site about Internet of Things devices."), and illustration and fine arts painting.

### What hardware do you use?

I use a [2013 13" MacBook Pro][macbook-pro] for development and design work and this is the device I travel with, but I also use a [Chromebook Pixel][chromebook-pixel] for just general browsing or writing at home. I recently got an [iPad Pro][ipad-pro] v2 10" and [Apple Pencil][apple-pencil], but I'm still warming up to that for art. My current phone is a [Google Pixel][pixel] v1 and I'm sticking with that because the new version has no headphone jack for my must-have [Bose QuietComfort 20s][quietcomfort-20i]. I also love my [Pebble Time Round][pebble-time-round] and wear it constantly, as I prefer to get alerts to that rather than pulling my phone out every other minute. For similar phone-avoiding reasons, I also like to have a Kindle to hand for reading and currently use the [Kindle Voyage][kindle-voyage]. I also carry this adorable [cheero PowerPlus Nyanboard Nyanbo][nyanboard-nyanbo-mobile-battery] battery.

On the art side, I work in oil paint, watercolour and gouache, and I cart everything around in a [Fjallraven Foldsack No.1][foldsack-no-1] in copper green.

### And what software?

I spend a large amount of my time inside [Chrome][], so my OS generally doesn't matter hugely, however I absolutely hate the [OSX Dock][dock] and hide it completely on my Mac. Instead, I get around my machine using [Alfred][] and [Terminal][]. [Google Calendar][google-calendar] and [Gmail][] (with very heavy filters and labels) rule my days, and I've been experimenting with using [Todoist][] now it has GCal integration. When I've wanted real power-tools for todo lists, though, nothing has beaten [GQueues][].

For code, I use [Sublime Text][sublime-text], but honestly it could be [Notepad][] for all I use the advanced features, and I've been playing with [Glitch][glitch.3] lately for fun little personal projects. On the design side, I prefer to actually just knock-up actual websites to show wireframes, so I'd be lost without [Chrome DevTools][chrome-devtools].

I have [Spotify][] on every platform, and prefer just throwing on a [Daily Mix](https://support.spotify.com/us/using_spotify/discover_music/daily-mix/ "Spotify's music playlists generated by algorithms.") and seeing what comes up.

### What would be your dream setup?

I can work pretty much anywhere and on any hardware, so I don't have a dream in those terms but if I could pick an aesthetic for my ideal live/work location, it would probably look something like Ferris Bueller's-best-friend [Cameron's house](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Rose_House "The Wikipedia entry for the Ben Rose House.") or the [Blueshore ELC building](http://www.cheakamuscentre.ca/about-us/elc "An environmental learning center.") used as a filming location in Legion -- all glass walls and wood in a beautiful natural environment. I work best with lots of natural light and a very controllable environment in terms of sound and temperature and I like to be in a space that responds automatically to my needs - it's probably why I'm drawn to smart home technology. I'm pretty happy with my setup today, though, and I couldn't really ask for much more. 

Maybe a teleporter to more easily pop back to London?
