#### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm [Lauren Gallagher](https://www.laurengallagher.co/ "Lauren's website."), a Chicago-based graphic designer, currently working as the Lead Designer for [Cards Against Humanity](https://cardsagainsthumanity.com/ "A card game."). I also help curate our office [gallery space](http://www.blackbox.gallery/ "An art gallery curated by Cards Against Humanity and the Chicago Design Museum.") with the Chicago Design Museum, and assist in running a small [printing press](https://www.instagram.com/notgoodpress/ "The Bad Press Instagram account.").

#### What hardware do you use?

I usually start a design project by writing a list about the brief in my sketchbook, which is usually a Field Notes or Moleskine. Then I move onto sketching. I like using colored [MUJI pens][gel-ink-0.38mm] so I can include grids or directions within each sketch. After that it depends on the project, but I do all of my digital design work on a [15" MacBook Pro][macbook-pro]. If I'm working on a print piece for Cards Against Humanity or for myself, I might print in-house on our [HP DesignJet T520][designjet-t520] or risograph it on our [RISO EZ391U][ez391u].

#### And what software?

[Adobe Illustrator][illustrator], [InDesign][], and [Photoshop][] for design, [Sketch][] and [Sublime Text][sublime-text] for front-end, [Slack][] for communication, [Bear][] for note-taking, [Flow][] for project management, [Pocket][] for saving online articles, and [Spotify][] for music-listening. I'd like to learn [Cinema 4D][cinema-4d] or [Blender][] to start incorporating 3D into my practice.

#### What would be your dream setup?

To be the honest the Cards Against Humanity office is pretty close to ideal. The office functions as a coworking space for local writers, podcasters, game designers, web developers, photographers, puzzle makers... the list gets longer and weirder. I love getting to know them, their willingness to share their knowledge and talent is invaluable. It's my favorite part about working at Cards Against Humanity. The only thing I'd want is a more spacious print studio for everyone to share.
