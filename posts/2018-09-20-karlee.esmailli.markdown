#### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm [Karlee Esmailli](http://www.karlee.me/ "Karlee's website."). I'm the Head of Accounts at Blackbox and Cards Against Humanity. I'm also a writer and video game degenerate. 

#### What hardware do you use?

For work, I use a Mac and an iPhone, but I don't know what kind of Mac or iPhone!! Don't ask me!! I'm all about my bullet journals. 

For fun, I adore the [Womanizer Pro40 Sensual Pleasure Enhancer][pro40] in Magenta and the [Nintendo Switch][switch.2].

#### What would be your dream setup?

I'd love to be left alone with my cat and boyfriend on top of a mountain. We'd have perfect fiber internet and each day a young child from the village would bring us fresh tomatoes and baguette and cheeses from the mountain cows. I'd write with a nice clacky keyboard.
