### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm [Mari Andrew](http://bymariandrew.com/ "Mari's website."), an illustrator and writer currently based in Washington, DC but I'm constantly roaming around. I publish one comic a day, and I'll have a book of illustrated essays coming out in the near-ish future.

### What hardware do you use?

I use a Sharpie pen and a travel watercolor set I got on Amazon for $19.99. I think it's time to upgrade. I still write most of my thoughts and essays down in a notebook; I'm much pickier about paper than I am about my tools. The brand Appointed makes beautiful paper products, especially for those of us who love to write on graph paper.

### And what software?

[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/bymariandrew/ "Mari's Instagram account.") and [Google Docs][google-docs] -- I'm a modern woman. I'd love to fancy myself free from social media, but I owe so much to it. I think artists have this incredible advantage these days to build relationships with their audience and be able to get reactions in real-time. I imagine it's the sort of experience that musicians have always had -- that immediacy and intimacy with their audience -- and artists are just now getting to have that too.

### What would be your dream setup?

My dream set-up would be to have all the time in the world to devote to my creative pursuits, in a spacious loft somewhere in Southern Spain. Right now I work out of a [small art studio](http://www.thelemonbowldc.com/ "An art studio in Washington D.C.") from 6-8am every morning because I also have a 9-5 job. I feel cramped in both my time and space, but I'm going to devote the upcoming year to finding more physical and temporal space to finish my book and keep exploring artistically. I'd also love this scenario to include a wall pen holder.
