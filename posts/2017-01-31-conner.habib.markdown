### Who are you, and what do you do?

Hi, I'm [Conner Habib](https://connerhabib.wordpress.com/ "Conner's website."). I'm a writer, a writing coach, a lecturer, and an activist. For eight years, I was a gay porn star, which I still do on occasion, just not as often now because I like eating donuts way more than I like going to the gym. I have a hunch that I'm the only person who's ever won awards for teaching, writing, and porn.

As far as writing goes: I'm writing a book about critical theory and the occult, revising a screenplay and a play, and [meeting with writing coaching clients every week](https://connerhabib.wordpress.com/writing-coach/ "Conner's writing coach page."). For lectures: I speak at universities and organizations around the world about sexuality, sex and I also give lectures online courses about philosophical and occult topics. 

### What hardware do you use?

I'm sure there are lots of porn-related jokes about hardware here. My life is pretty analog except for my Mac. I read books; books books, not on screens. When I give talks at schools, I usually just talk in that old school storytelling way. Also: coffee.

### And what software?

When I give online courses, I sell tickets through [Eventbrite][] and conduct the courses on [Zoom][zoom.2]. Both are easy. When I meet with writing coaching clients that don't live in LA, I use [Skype][].

### What would be your dream setup?

I'm pretty happy with my own life, but it's not been easy getting here; so my dream setup is a worldwide thing: Technologies or a new ways of thinking or organizations geared towards getting people out of the 9-5 workforce (if they want out) and toward doing the things they really care about. 

I don't mean the old trope of "do what you love" where you're a tech employee eating cereal in the office at 11AM, and then sliding down an inflatable tech campus slide while inwardly feeling like your soul is dying. Or where you have an office job that dims your light every day and that your idiot boss thinks can be redeemed by Crazy Hat Fridays. 

Instead, I mean setups aimed at making your day truly meaningful to you, and that would get you participating in the world in a way you'd love.

My dream setups are setups that help create a world where everyone is happier in and loving their days.
