### Who are you, and what do you do?

I am [Taylor Moore](https://twitter.com/taylordotbiz "Taylor's Twitter account."). I created and run Fortunate Horse, a comedy label. In the past we've made books, magazines, and TV. Now we make podcasts, such as [Rude Tales of Magic](https://www.rudetalesofmagic.com/ "A fantasy podcast.") (loony toons fantasy), [Fun City](https://funcity.ventures/ "A cyberpunk-themed podcast.") (madcap cyberpunk noire), [Oh These Those Stars of Space](https://www.patreon.com/ohthesethosestarsofspace "A space-themed podcast.") (episodic starship chaos), and an undisclosed new project announcing this summer. Between these shows, to varying degrees, I act as performer, producer, writer, editor, composer, and business manager. 

### What hardware do you use?

[Shure SM7B microphones][sm7b]. Scarlett and Motu audio interfaces. [MacBook Pros][macbook-pro], iPads, iPhones. [Native Instruments KOMPLETE KONTROL S88 MK2][komplete-kontrol-s88] (digital piano keyboard). [Sony MDR-7506 headphones][mdr-7506]. Multiple external monitors. A Logitech vertical mouse that I love. An 5ft tall office chair I built from parts. Standing desk built from discarded tables from an old office job. A shelf of hard drives including a 16TB NAS. 1gig up/down internet connection and approximately one million dongles, extensions, and adapters.

And a vast galaxy of plugins, virtual instruments, and sample libraries that number too many to name.

### What would be your dream setup?

Enough monitor real estate to block out the sun or a USB-C port in the back of my head. Barring those two: early retirement.
