### Who are you, and what do you do?

My name is [Anton Gudim](https://www.instagram.com/gudim_public/ "Anton's Instagram account."). I'm just a random person who is bored and who is interested in coming up with strange ideas. But you can call me an illustrator, for example.

### What hardware do you use?

I use a desk, laptop, computer mouse and almost all my free time.

### And what software?

I draw in Adobe [Illustrator][] and make some colour corrections in Adobe [Photoshop][]. The presence of a small amount of software and the use of basic hardware allows me to be more mobile and draw in any place where there is a regular laptop with Illustrator on it.

At first I was very upset that I draw with the mouse and do not use a graphics tablet, but then I took it as a feature of my style.

### What would be your dream setup?

My dream is to have an inexhaustible source of ideas and, of course, to develop in the field of drawing. Since at the moment I have to combine creativity and work as an engineer, I would like to devote my life to creativity and be an independent (financially and mentally) illustrator.
