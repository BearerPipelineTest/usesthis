### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm [Banana Chan](https://twitter.com/bananachangames "Banana's Twitter account."), I'm the owner and co-founder of a small-box board game and RPG publishing company called [Game and a Curry](http://gameandacurry.com/ "Banana's game company."). I also design and write games. One of the games that I have out on Kickstarter now is [_Jiangshi: Blood in the Banquet Hall_](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jiangshi/jiangshi-blood-in-the-banquet-hall/ "Banana's tabletop game on Kickstarter."), a collaborative storytelling tabletop RPG where players take on the role of a Chinese immigrant family running a restaurant in 1920's Chinatown. The game deals with oppression and the stresses of running a restaurant in the day and at night, hopping vampires (jiangshi) come out and the family has to survive them!

### What hardware do you use?

I have two [MacBook Pros][macbook-pro] (one is from my day job) that I go back and forth on. Since I work with tabletop games, I use whiteboards and dry erase pens to go back and forth on ideas and timelines (I like the tactile nature of a physical board). I also use a lot of paper and cardboard for making physical prototypes.

### And what software?

For designing, I always use [Google Docs][google-docs], [Slides][google-slides] and [Sheets][google-sheets]. When I start designing character sheets, cards and anything like that, I use [Illustrator][]. If I wanted to start making a trailer (because I'm a video producer by day), I use [Premiere][]!

### What would be your dream setup?

A room just full of screens connected to two laptops (because I hate having to sit in one spot all the time). And that way, I can switch back and forth between (video) gaming and working!
