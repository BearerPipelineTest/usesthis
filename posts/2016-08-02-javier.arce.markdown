#### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm a web developer, designer, and illustrator (or at least I've deceived enough people in the past to consider myself those three things).

I'm currently working for [CARTO][] as a front-end developer in Madrid.

Besides deceiving people and doing map-related stuff, I spend most of my time making [silly personal projects](http://javier.is/ "Javier's website."), [drawing](http://drawings.javier.is/ "Javier's drawings."), [taking pictures](http://photos.javier.is/ "Javier's photos."), and [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5987858-javier "Javier's GoodReads account.").

#### What hardware do you use?

My life revolves around a 13-inch [MacBook Air][macbook-air], which I usually connect to a 23.8" Dell [UltraSharp U2414H monitor][ultrasharp-up2414h], a pleasantly noisy [Vortex Poker 3][pok3r] (Cherry Mx-Blue) and a [Wacom Intuos Pro S][intuos-pro].

When I'm on the road, I use an [iPhone SE][iphone-se] both to [take pictures](http://instagram.com/javier "Javier's Instagram account.") but also to feel bad about compulsively refreshing social media feeds.

Apart from my phone, these days my current digital camera of choice is a [Panasonic GX80][lumix-dmc-gx80] with that nice 20mm f1.7 pancake lens they produced some years ago.

Oh, and my favorite pen is the phenomenal [Kuretake Fudegokochi Brush Pen][fudegokochi-brush-pen] - Regular.

#### And what software?

I write and code with [vim][] and use several private [GitHub][] repos to store my writing (ideas, todo lists, notes on the books I'm reading, etc.). I sometimes take notes with [nvALT][] and write longer pieces with [iA Writer][ia-writer], but I always come back to vim.

For my drawings, I work with [Adobe Illustrator][illustrator] (with the invaluable help of the amazing [VectorScribe][] plugin)

I manage all of my passwords using [1Password][]. My assets are stored in [Dropbox][] folders, using a classification system that could be described as the "reverse Kondo method" (i.e.: I just create folders and throw things inside).

#### What would be your dream setup?

Computer-wise I'm pretty happy with my current setup. If I could get my hand on a [Leica Q][q.2] I would be super duper happy, though.
